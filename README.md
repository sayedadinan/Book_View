# Books App ðŸ“š

A Flutter-based application designed to showcase books, authors, and their ratings. This project is built using the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** architecture, ensuring a clean and scalable codebase. It also includes a robust theme-switching mechanism, API integrations, and custom utilities for efficient development.


## âœ¨ Key Features

1. **BLoC Architecture**: The project leverages the power of the BLoC pattern to manage state and business logic effectively.
2. **Theme Switching**: 
   - Light and dark themes are integrated into the project.
   - While no UI button is provided to toggle the theme, the functionality exists in the codebase via `ThemeBloc`. Developers can easily add a button or switch in the UI to trigger theme changes.
3. **Dependency Injection**: Managed using a DI container for clean and scalable dependency management.
4. **MultiBlocProvider Setup**: 
   - Manages multiple BLoC instances like `AuthBloc`, `AuthorBloc`, `BookBloc`, and `RatingBloc`.
   - Ensures efficient state management across the app.
5. **Shared Preferences Initialization**: Enables persistent data storage for session management and user preferences.
6. **Dynamic Routing**: Powered by `GoRouter` for clean and declarative navigation.
7. **Customizable Colors**: Centralized in `AppColors` for consistent styling and easier maintenance.
8. **Gradient Colors**: Predefined gradients for visually appealing designs.
9. **Error Handling and Extensibility**: Includes extensions and utilities for seamless error handling and functionality expansion.
